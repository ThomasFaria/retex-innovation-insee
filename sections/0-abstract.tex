\abstract{
In recent years, statisticians equipped with data science skills have been joining National Statistical Offices (NSOs), aiming to harness non-traditional data sources and machine learning methods to enhance the production of official statistics. Despite their expertise, these professionals encounter significant barriers, including inadequate IT infrastructures, a gap in necessary computational resources, and a transition from innovative experiments to production-ready solutions. This paper presents Onyxia, an open-source project developed to address these challenges by enabling organizations to build modern and flexible data science environments that enhance the autonomy of statisticians. With Onyxia and its demonstration instance, the SSP Cloud, we showcase how cloud technologies can be made accessible, fostering innovation, collaboration, and reproducibility within the realm of official statistics. Through a case study of the classification of the activity domain of French companies, we show how these tools have been instrumental in operationalizing machine learning models in accordance with MLOps principles, marking a significant step forward in the utilization of data science at Insee.

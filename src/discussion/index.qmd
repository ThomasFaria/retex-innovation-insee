# Discussion

The development of data science methods offers considerable potential for official statistics. However, our ability to create value from these new methods essentially depends on our capacity to produce production-grade systems that serve their purpose in a robust way. This evolution calls for deep reflection on what constitutes a modern, scalable data science infrastructure for official statistics. This article presents the Onyxia project, the proposal for such a platform that we are developing at Insee. By exploiting cloud-native technologies that have become standards in the data eco-system, it aims to increase statisticians' autonomy in the orchestration of their statistical treatments, while promoting reproducibility of produced statistics. As cloud technologies are notoriously difficult to configure, the core value of Onyxia's lies in making them accessible to statisticians via a user-friendly interface and a catalog of pre-configured services to cover most common uses. Through an internal project aiming at revising the NACE classification process using machine learning methods, we illustrate how Onyxia enables to iteratively build production-grade machine learning projects that promote continuous improvement, a fundamental principle of the MLOps approach.

Initially developed as an internal project, Onyxia has gained recognition beyond the scope of Insee or the French administration. Convinced of the potential of cloud technologies to foster autonomy and leverage the full potential of data science, several organizations now have a production instance of Onyxia running, and multiple others are in the process of either testing or implementing one. Besides, the choice of Onyxia as the reference data science platform in the context of the AIML4OS project should further facilitate its adoption within the ESS. This trend is naturally very beneficial to the Onyxia project, as it moves from a project developed in open-source — but mainly at Insee — to a full open-source project with a growing base of contributors. This in turn facilitates its adoption by other organizations, since it gives more guarantees on its sustainability independently of Insee's strategy. The governance of the project is currently evolving to reflect this trend. For instance with the organization of monthly community calls and the creation of a public channel and roadmap for the project[^onyxia-project].

Despite this success, we observe several limitations to the widespread adoption of the project in organizations. First, it is essential to remind that the fundamental choice made by organizations that adopt Onyxia is not the software itself, but the underlying technologies: containerization (through Kubernetes) and object storage. These technologies can represent substantial entry costs for organizations, as they demand a significant commitment to developing and maintaining skills which are not readily found in NSOs. Yet, the general trend towards cloud-native solutions among data-centric organizations suggests a favourable shift that could mitigate these challenges over time.

Similarly, the transition towards cloud-native technologies induces entry costs for statisticians. First, they often deal with a loss of references regarding where computations actually happen: while they may be accustomed to performing computation on centralized servers rather than a personal computer, the container adds a layer of abstraction that make the location hard to grasp at first. But the major perceived change in this paradigm is the loss of data persistence. In traditional setups — either a personal computer or a server accessed through a virtual desktop — the code, the data and the computing environment are kind of mixed in a black box fashion. On the contrary, containers have no persistence by design. While object storage provides this persistence, a proper use of these infrastructures for statistical projects require a variety of tools and corresponding skills: using a version control system for the code, interacting with the object storage API to store the data, providing configuration files or secrets as inputs, etc. In a way, these entry costs can be seen as the "price" of autonomy: thanks to cloud-native technologies, statisticians now have access to scalable and flexible environments that enable them to experiment more freely, but this autonomy requires a significant skills upgrade which may be overwhelming at first and limit adoption. However, our experience at Insee suggests that this effect can largely be mitigated through a combination of training statisticians to development best practices and accompanying statistical projects when transitioning to cloud infrastructures.

While Onyxia has significantly democratized access to cloud-native technologies for statisticians, the actual integration of data science methods in the statistical production of NSOs encompasses broader challenges, organizational in nature. A major hindsight from the deployment of our first ML model in production is the necessity to overcome skill compartmentalization across IT, business, and innovation teams. By nature, production-grade ML projects involve a wide range of skills — knowledge of the business domain, model training and fine-tuning, deployment and monitoring — and thus effective collaboration between professionals with different work cultures, programming languages, etc. Our experience shows that cloud technologies, by fostering autonomy of data scientists, give more continuity to ML projects and facilitate this much needed collaboration between various profiles. However, fully addressing these challenges involve measures that go beyond the technical domain. For instance, embedding some data science capabilities directly within business teams, in complement of centralized innovation teams, could foster better alignment with project objectives. Also, recruiting profiles that are not typically present in NSOs, such as data engineers or ML engineers, could bring new essential skills that lie at the intersection of statistical methodology and computer techniques. Ultimately, the transition towards a data science-driven approach in statistical production should rely on a balanced strategy that couples technical solutions such as Onyxia with comprehensive organizational adjustments, fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation.
